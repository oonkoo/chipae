# Docs Directory

When authoring or editing files in this directory, follow these standards.

## Architecture Decision Records (`docs/architecture/`)

Use the ADR template: `.claude/docs/templates/architecture-decision-record.md`

**Required sections:** Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences,
ADR Dependencies, Engine Compatibility, GDD Requirements Addressed

**Status lifecycle:** `Proposed` → `Accepted` → `Superseded`
- Never skip `Accepted` — stories referencing a `Proposed` ADR are auto-blocked
- Use `/architecture-decision` to create ADRs through the guided flow

**TR Registry:** `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml`
- Stable requirement IDs (e.g. `TR-MOV-001`) that link GDD requirements to stories
- Never renumber existing IDs — only append new ones
- Updated by `/architecture-review` Phase 8

**Control Manifest:** `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`
- Flat programmer rules sheet: Required / Forbidden / Guardrails per layer
- Date-stamped `Manifest Version:` in header
- Stories embed this version; `/story-done` checks for staleness

**Validation:** Run `/architecture-review` after completing a set of ADRs.

## Engine Reference (`docs/engine-reference/`)

**Not applicable to this project.** The Godot / Unity / Unreal snapshots here are
template leftovers — Chipae runs in the browser on Next.js 16 + React 19. Ignore
them entirely (see the root `CLAUDE.md`).

The equivalent source of truth for this stack is the bundled Next.js docs at
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (App Router under `01-app/`). Check there before
using any framework API you aren't certain about.
